Overview

This project demonstrates how to train a custom named entity recognition (NER) model using SpaCy, a popular natural language processing (NLP) library. In text, a model is built to identify entities. Specific entities such as judges, locations, and organizations can effectively train models to recognize these entities using labeled examples. and can be extended to support additional optimal entities if needed...
feature

    Custom Entity Detection: Train SpaCy models to recognize specific entities in your messages.
    Flexible and extensible: Easily add new entity types to the model as needed.
    Labeled training data: Use annotated samples to improve the accuracy and performance of the model.
    Easy Integration: Use trained models in your applications for real-time entity recognition.
